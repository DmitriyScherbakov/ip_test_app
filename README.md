# Movie app

## For the developer
Dear friend, the repository was taken from some old project. It was chaos, but it turned into something that worked. The structure of the project is quite simple, I didn’t bother too much due to the fact that I don’t get paid for it (I hope you understand). If you have any questions, you can contact tg: @alxndr_schrbkv. Hours spent on this nonsense - 16. I did it on android only. I hope it works on your side))))
Good luck!
## How to run project

2. Run command `npm i` in terminal (console) for installing all required packages (Node.js is required: <https://nodejs.org/en/>)
3. For builing project you can use the following commands:
   - `open -a Simulator && expo start` - runs app on simulator (then press `i` for iPhone)

U can use expo go app - then run:
